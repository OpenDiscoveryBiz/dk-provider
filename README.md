# DK Business Service Provider
This specific example of a national/regional Business Service Provider should ultimately be hosted by a public Danish authority. It is used by the [resolver](https://github.com/OpenDiscoveryBiz/resolver) to lookup the specific Business Service Provider chosen by a business entity. It has a purpose similar to the DNS servers that are authoritative for a specific top level domain (e.g. the ".dk" domain).

The DK Business Service Provider is one of several components needed to enable Distributed Business Service Discovery scenarios.

These components are currently under initial development and we welcome collaboration on the further development of scope and principles (Contact: [Henrik Biering](mailto:hb@peercraft.com)) as well as the technical implementation (Contact: [Casper Biering](mailto:cb@peercraft.com)).
